Hi Diego,

Thanks for sharing your thoughts and expectations regarding compensation. Mikey enjoyed your conversation and felt that your skills and knowledge applicable to balena as well as your enthusiasm about our problem space and the challenges we are tackling could make you successful here. We are keen to move forward!

The next step is the take-home assignment, which we believe will give you the opportunity to showcase your technical strengths. Our main goal is to find out how you handle a scenario with the constraints and vagueness of the real world.
Please find the requirements in the README here: Analytics Engineer - [Take-Home Challenge](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LeaGZc5oO35k-zlBXhvQw4cbGPoxPldU?usp=sharing)

Language:

It's fine to write and submit your solution in the language you are more comfortable with. That said, at balena we use Typescript and the node.js stack​ more and more for data-related tasks and we’d expect new hires to be ready and willing to adapt to our stack.​ 

We will give you extra points for:

Well articulated assumptions and justification of choices
Indicating potential shortcomings and how you would approach them
Using the given dataset to do some extra analysis that could support/invalidate your arguments
Following good data presentation and visualization practices
Adding instructions on how to run your code (e.g. a docker file, list of library dependencies, makefile)
Duration & submission process:

This assignment has been designed to take 4-5 hours, but it depends on your personal pace and prioritization, as well as your level of familiarity with the context, languages, frameworks, and libs you choose to use.

​Please share a link to the zip folder on the cloud that contains your completed work. We suggest you don't try to attach the .zip to the email; usually, the submitted file sizes exceed the max. allowed by common email clients.

We’d appreciate it if you didn’t publish your solution in public services such as GitHub, as that might give an unfair advantage to future candidates.

When you email us, please take 10-15 minutes to answer these questions:

About how long did you spend on it?
If you had more time, what would you do?
What is your feedback on the assignment?
We want this assignment to be a flexible way to show your skills, and we know life can be very busy — there's no hard deadline. However, if you're not able to get it back to us within a week or two, please give us a heads up.

Next steps:

As soon as you are ready, please share your solution and availability, and we will schedule a follow-up call (video chat) to talk through your work, share some feedback, and have a broader technical discussion. 

Good luck, and enjoy,
Natasa​
